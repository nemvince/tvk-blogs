<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to tvk.lol!</h1>

I'm Vince, and this is my personal little web project, which serves you ZERO JavaScript by default. And no, you can't enable it, it has no client-side JavaScript at all.

Actually, I hate JavaScript so much that I even wrote this page in Markdown. In fact, the entire site is built using Hono and hono/jsx+marked to render Markdown files, with no JavaScript sent to the client. Enjoy the simplicity!

## What do I do?

I go to school, code stuff, break my homelab, and occasionally write blog posts about my experiences. Feel free to explore my [blog](/blog) for more insights!

### Competitions

I participate in various programming and sysadmin competitions, here's the ones where I have notable achievements:

|                                      |          |                     |        |   |   |   |   |   |   |
